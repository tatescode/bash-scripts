# Welcome To My Scripts Repository

I use Linux a lot. As such, I like to create BASH scripts to automate tasks and enhance the workflow of my system.

Not all of these scripts will be useful for your specific system, as I mainly created these with my specific Operating System (Linux) and Distrobution (Arch) in mind.
