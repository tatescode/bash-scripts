# Welcome To My Scripts Repository 

I use Linux a lot. As such, I like to create BASH scripts to automate tasks and enhance the workflow of my system.![31-313431_transparent-write-icon-png-test-script-icon-png-2483381349](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c689ddd1-cc01-432d-81af-b5f64ffb9c8c)


Not all of these scripts will be useful for your specific system, as I mainly created these with my specific Operating System (GNU/Linux) and Distrobution (Arch) in mind.

*Side note: Just because I like BASH does not mean ALL of these scripts are BASH scripts. There will most likely be Python and Powershell scripts mixed in here as well.*
